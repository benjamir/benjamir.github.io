Hello visitor, my name is Benjamin.
I'm a father of two, currentlyy working as a system administrator for the chair of computational linguistics in Jena, Germany.

When I'm not at playgrounds with the kids, or taking care of a compute and virtualization cluster, I enjoy meeting friends for card- and board games, or MÃ¶lkky outdoors.
If time permits I try to revive my guitar playing skills, or raise whatever seeds (avocado, pepper bell, potatos, fenugreek, ...) comes my way out of curiosity.

Have a question? Feel free to send a polite e-mail to mail@benjaminrampe.de
