Hello visitor :) My name is Benjamin and I'm a father of two working as a system administrator for the chair of computerlinguistics since 2006.

If time permits I'm meeting friends for Doppelkopf and board games (Pandemic!) or try to refresh my neglected guitar playing skills. Rocksmith really got me hooked -- and made me try and buy a PJ bass. Now I cannot decide what's more fun! =8)
Occasionally I do first little steps into windowsill gardening or adopt unloved plants in the office -- my permanent office partner is a survival plant named ["Rüdiger"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%BCdiger_Nehberg "Rüdiger Nehberg") :^)

Obviously I'm old-skool according to my preferred style of smilies.
