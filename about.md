Hello visitor, my name is Benjamin.

I'm a father of two, working as a system administrator for the chair of computational linguistics in Jena, Germany.

When I'm not at playgrounds with my kids, or taking care of a compute and virtualization cluster, I enjoy meeting friends for card- and board games, or MÃ¶lkky outdoors.
If time permits I try to revive my guitar playing skills, or raise whatever seeds come my way.

Have a question? Feel free to send a polite e-mail to mail@benjaminrampe.de
