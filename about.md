Hello visitor, my name is Benjamin. I'm a father of two, working as a system administrator for the chair of computational linguistics in Jena, Germany since 2006.

When I'm not at playgrounds with the kids, or taking care of a compute and virtualization cluster, I enjoy meeting friends for Doppelkopf, board games (Pandemic, Dominion, etc.) or preferably outdoors: MÃ¶lkky.

For recreational purpose ***without*** others, I try to improve my guitar playing skills -- acoustic, electric and bass guitar.
Coming from a finger-style background I set myself the challenge to overcome my struggle with a pick the coming years; and keep advancing my understanding of music theory in baby steps. (If you want to start a band of beginners in Jena, please mail me so that I can remove "without others" here!).

Occasionally I dabble around with windowsill gardening by randomly trying to grow any seeds or seedlings I coincidentally get my hands on. 
Inside my office you might find pitiful plants, because I sometimes adopt orphaned plants -- no matter their aesthetics -- and try to revive them.

If want to get in contact with me you can send me an polite e-mail to mail@benjaminrampe.de
