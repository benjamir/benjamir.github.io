Hello visitor, my name is Benjamin.

I'm a father of two, working as a system administrator for the chair of computational linguistics in Jena, Germany.

When I'm not at playgrounds with my kids, or taking care of a compute and virtualization cluster, I enjoy meeting friends for card- and board games, or MÃ¶lkky outdoors.
If time permits I try to revive my guitar playing skills, or raise whatever seeds come my way.

Have a question? Feel free to send a polite e-mail to mail@benjaminrampe.de

~~If you're into GPG you might be intereseted in:~~ (I stopped maintaining a GPG key, because nobody I communicate with via a secure channel is using it anymore)

There are IT-related articles and postings by another "Benjamin Rampe" (my birth name) and another "Benjamin Redling" (my current name). 
Unlike me, both are or were working for Microsoft.

Occasional posts written by me are in the following mailing lists:
- ansible-project
- ganeti
- slurm-users (fka. slurm-dev)
- proxmox (after a very long break from version 2.x to 6.0, I'm interested again)
- gluster-users

And in former times:
- backuppc
- borgbackup
- checkmk-de (they changed to a forum -- I prefer old school mail; since then I'm only consuming via their read-only mail gateway)
- checkmk-en (they changed to a forum -- I prefer old school mail; since then I'm only consuming via their read-only mail gateway)
