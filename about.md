Hello visitor :) My name is Benjamin and I'm a father of two working as a system administrator for the chair of computerlinguistics in Jena, Germany since 2006.

If time permits I'm meeting friends for Doppelkopf and board games (Pandemic!) or try to refresh my neglected guitar playing skills. Rocksmith really got me hooked and the only game within a decade that will stay -- made me try and buy a PJ bass.

Occasionally I do first little steps into windowsill gardening or adopt unloved plants in the office. One of my permanent office assistants is a [money plant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epipremnum_aureum "money plant"
) named ["Rüdiger"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%BCdiger_Nehberg "Rüdiger Nehberg"). On a label sticking in its pot was written "survival plant" :^) And thanks for cleaning my air, ... Rüdi.

Obviously I prefer old-skool smilies.
