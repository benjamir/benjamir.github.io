Hello visitor, my name is Benjamin.

I'm an IT system administrator. I try to write down notes important to me, but honestly often fail to publish most of my personal notebook.
I prefer fossil SCM over git, for personal notetaking and as kind of knowledge base.

Have a question? Feel free to send a polite e-mail to mail@benjaminrampe.de

(I stopped using GPG for the time being. I used it maybe a handful of times within a decade and in the meantime it doesn't seem to be worth the troubles. Friends use other secure channels, the general population doesn't care about signing emails, so why maintain something just for the sake of it.)

Occasional posts written by me are in the following mailing lists:
- ansible-project
- checkmk-de
- checkmk-en
- ganeti
- slurm-users (fka. slurm-dev)
- proxmox

And in former times:
- backuppc
- borgbackup
