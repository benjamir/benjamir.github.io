Hello visitor, my name is Benjamin and I'm a father of two working as a system administrator for the chair of computerlinguistics in Jena, Germany since 2006.

When I'm not at playgrounds with the kids, or taking care of a compute and virtualization cluster, I enjoy meeting friends for Doppelkopf and board games. I recently got into cooperative ones and really wonder why that genre isn't more prevalent considering its educational value.
For recreational purpose without others, I try to improve my acccoutic, electic and bass guitar playing skills. Coming from a fingerstyle background I set myself the challenge to overcome my struggle with a pick the coming years; and keep advancing my understanding of music theory in baby steps. (If you want to start a band of beginners in Jena, please mail me so that I can remove "without others" here!).
Occasionally I dabble around with windowsill gardening by randomly trying to grow any seeds or seedlings I coincidentally get my hands on, or adopt orphaned plants in the office, no matter their aesthetics.

If want to get in contact with me you can send me an polite e-mail to mail@benjaminrampe.de
