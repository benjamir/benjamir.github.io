Today I have hidden most posting despite there being only few.
The short technical one might become part of a general cheat sheet -- or maybe I unhide them again.
The "rants" either need a solution, or have to be toned down -- otherwise I currently want to just delete them. The rage might have been justified in that moment, but re-reading them just tieres me: nothing to gain from, not worth spreading.
